        "Don't pretend it's such a mystery, think about the place where you first met me",
        "And it's all good if you're bad, and it's okay if you're mad",
        "Ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?",
        "I wouldn't marry me either, a pathological people pleaser",
        "If I was a man, then I'd be the man",
        "Who could ever leave me, darling? But who could stay?",
        "Oh my, love is a lie, shit my friends say to get me by",
        "I promise that you'll never find another like me",
        "If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing",
        "The best people in life are free"
